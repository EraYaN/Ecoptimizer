\subsection*{First-wave (N=3)}
\subsubsection*{User ID 1, Advanced}
User had their route plotted and chosen in less then 1 minute.
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{p{\resulttablecolone}|p{\resulttablecoltwo}}
\textbf{Origin} & Vianen \\
\textbf{Mode of transport} & Car \\
\textbf{Rationale} & ``I live a long way from the nearest bus stop and cycling is way to far.'' \\
\textbf{Remarks (function)} & ``The number doesn't say anything, maybe add a visual element.'' \\
\textbf{Rem. (look-and-feel)} & ``It looks pretty neat but line up this part here (points to the mode of transport buttons). Other than that I think it looks okay.'' \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Reflection: Is a designer so the non-lined up stuff bothers him. (I fixed it obviously). Lives in rural area.

\subsubsection*{User ID 2, Beginner}
User had their route plotted in about 3 minutes, but did not want to travel to Amsterdam. User did want to travel to Nieuwegein which is much closer (by car).
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{p{\resulttablecolone}|p{\resulttablecoltwo}}
\textbf{Origin} & Vianen \\
\textbf{Mode of transport} & None \\
\textbf{Rationale} & ``I don't want to travel all the way. I don't like driving the car on the highway anymore. And buses are just to much of a bother. Can I try Nieuwegein? (...) User goes by car, buses are too much of a both and user is not old enough for the Valys. (sic)'' \\
\textbf{Remarks (function)} & ``You did a good job.'' \\
\textbf{Rem. (look-and-feel)} & ``It is just really nice that you can make these kinds of things, you will go on to make a lot of money.'' \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Reflection: Grandfathers are biased... Everything you do is great somehow. It must be noted that my grand father is not your typical grandfather, he uses his laptop and an iPhone quite a lot and loves playing around on them. At the time my grandma was very sick, she passed away 3 weeks later.

\subsubsection*{User ID 3, Expert}
User had their route plotted in less than 1 minute.
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{p{\resulttablecolone}|p{\resulttablecoltwo}}
\textbf{Origin} & The Hague \\
\textbf{Mode of transport} & Public Transport (via The Hague HS) \\
\textbf{Rationale} & ``It's the easiest. I'm not cycling or walking to Amsterdam.'' \\
\textbf{Remarks (function)} & ``I don't see how this is sightly relevant or useful, I know cars are bad, funny that public transport is not even a little bad.'' \\
\textbf{Rem. (look-and-feel)} & ``It needs more smileys.'' \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Reflection: Well.. yes the visual indicator again. And someone who does not really care about enviroment and does not have a car.

\subsubsection*{First wave reflection}
I need to fixed somethings and I will add a dynamic smiley. Will have to see in the next wave if that helps.
